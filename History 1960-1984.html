          <p>A large mobile borer was rushed  from Brisbane and a rescue squad of 60 was given the task of tunneling down. At 0815 Kerslake was pulled out feet first.</p>
          <p>During 1963 a committee was formed at Collinsville. This came about, although belatedly, following criticism by the Royal Commission into a disaster at Collinsville in 1954. At the time of the disaster, rescue equipment was available, however it was non-functional due to poor or non-existent maintenance.</p>

          <p><strong>April 16. </strong>A meeting in Rockhampton was convened to  address the subject of Mines Rescue. Representatives of the Central Queensland Coal Producers, the Queensland Coal Owners Association, and Department of Mines were present. It was agreed that there was a need for a rescue station at Blackwater and a committee of management to run it. The committee was called &ldquo;The Central Queensland Mines Rescue Brigade Committee&rdquo;, and the state at this time was divided into three localities for mines rescue purposes.</p>
          <p><strong>July 17.  </strong>Collinsville host local competition, three local teams and one from Booval lead by Len Rodgers. The winners of the Brooks Challenge Cup were Collinsville No.1 team led by Ken Robertson.</p>
          <p>The cup had been won by a team from Booval for 11 years prior to Collinsville as there were no other stations in Queensland. The cup presented by the Mills family was for competitions at Booval and after discussions, the Mines Minister decided to provide a new silver cup for the top rescue team in the state.</p>
          <p>A beautiful two foot high silver trophy was donated by the minister for mines Mr. Camm in honour of his under-secretary Mr. Healy for his past services in regards to the Mines Rescue activities. The trophy was named<strong> &ldquo;The E.K. Healy Cup&rdquo;.</strong></p>

Smoke started billowing from Number 5 and Hardie began walking to the entrance for a look. He got 25m when it blew. Hardie: <i>&ldquo;I recollect a suck back of material towards the tunnel mouth followed by a huge ball of bright red flame which shot out and illuminated the area for hundreds of feet&rdquo;</i></p>
          <p><i> &ldquo;Merv Jensen, Graham Smith and Clarence Wolski, Ron Hollett, John Halls, Pat Farrell part of a third shift waiting to go down were injured when the brick wall of the deputy's cabin blew over&rdquo;</i>.</p>

          <h5>Mining Inquiry</h5>
          <p><em>The presence of smoke indicated re-circulation to Hardie. Hardie and others reentered the mine at 11.15pm with a view to rectify the doors 40 yards out-buy of the underground haulage. They were unable to reach the doors due to smoke.</em></p>
          <p><em>A further attempt to reach the doors was made in breathing apparatus by way of traveling at pit bottom, this also failed.</em></p>
          <p><em>At this point Mr. Hardie said it was apparent that attempts to get around the fire in No.5 were finished and again returned to the surface at 12.15am 31 July.</em></p>
          <p><em>It was decided to investigate the practicability of cutting off the air intake from No.7 to No.5 which was feeding the fire in No.5. They returned to the surface at 0120am.</em></p>
          <p><em>Basing their findings on the conditions in No.7 it was decided that it was feasible to make an attempt to control the fire by temporarily sealing off stone drives from 7 to 5, some 500 yards from the surface.</em></p>
          <p><em>A team of men entered the No.7 tunnel with the intention of carrying this decision into effect. A short time afterwards, John Roach, a member of the team, rang the surface and advised that smoke was backing against the intake in No.7, where previously airflow was normal. Just after this, the explosion occurred.</em></p>
          <ol>
            <li><em>A spontaneous heating occurring in a pile of fallen coal in No.2 level of No.2 South section in No.5 mine of Box Flat Extended Collieries on the weekend of 29/30 July, 1972.</em></li>
            <li><em>This heating was assisted by the eleven hour fan stoppage, during which period the reduced air flow allowed the heat generated to accumulate to a point of self ignition.</em></li>
            <li><em>Fumes from the fire became evident in the intake airway.</em></li>
            <li><em>This heating developed into a large fire, which was assisted by the increased air flow when the mine fan was started.</em></li>
            <li><em>Efforts to extinguish or seal the fire were unsuccessful</em></li>
            <li><em>An explosive mixture of gases generated from the fire, and possible accompanied by water gas, was ignited. Coal dust was active in the explosions that propagated throughout the mine. </em></li>
          </ol>
          <p><em>There is little doubt in the minds of the inquiry, that re-circulation played a most important part in the events that night. It is clear that it was present at an early stage; certainly some hours before the explosion. Apparently, the significance of this condition did not impress itself on the minds of those responsible for the conduct of operations, or if it did, they did not accurately assess the potentiality of danger arising from it.</em></p>
          <p><em>It must be observed that it appears that no one questioned the course of conduct proposed, from which it follows that all present were apparently in agreement with the assessment of the position made.</em></p>
          <p><em>There were other experienced men present, who were aware that re-circulation was taking place, but it seems that they were more concerned with the danger of being overcome with smoke and gases contained in it.</em></p>
          <p><em>It appears that a failure of all these people to advert to the distinct possibility of danger from explosion stems from widespread lack of knowledge of the danger associated with the conditions which prevailed that night. It appears that this lack is general in the district, in as much as experienced and qualified personnel from other collieries comprised part of the Mines Rescue team that night, and none of them appear to have adverted to the danger of explosion.</em></p>
          <p><em>This is an area where education of all personnel associated with mining might be improved.</em></p>

        <div class="col-md-12"> <p>The State Coordinating Committee was formed. The committee  comprised the Chairman and Secretaries of the three brigades and was chaired by the Chief Inspector of Coal Mines. It was initiated following a curtailment of funds for the 1979/80 financial year, and it was also seen at the time that there was a pressing need to standardise various aspects of the organisation&rsquo;s activities and to establish mutual assistance.</p>
  <p>The committee quickly reached the conclusion that there was an urgent need to have an independent assessment made of the organisation of both open cut and underground mines rescue.  Mr. T. Marshall was subsequently appointed to undertake this work and he presented his report to the three committees in June 1981.</p>
  <p>The conclusion and recommendations made in his report are as follows.</p>
  <p><em>&quot;The mines rescue organisation at present provides a service oriented towards underground mining. There is a definite need for the organisation to expand its activities to provide for all mining, surface and underground, in fact there is an obligation under the Coal Mining Act to do so. It is recommended that the Mines Rescue for Queensland be organised on an industry basis catering for all mines.</em></p>
  <p><em>To build an integrated organisation for the State, a coordinating committee representing all areas and sections of the industry, endowed with the necessary power, should be established.</em></p>
  <p><em>A full-time director responsible to the proposed coordinating committee to carry out the policy and decisions of the committee is necessary. The next step is the recruitment of a small staff of specialists who can be made available as instructors and researchers.</em></p>
  <p><em>Standardisation of basic training, equipment and methods is a vital consideration and is best brought about by a committee, formed from all localities, of people involved in safety and knowing the present individual practical requirements of the Queensland mining industry.</em></p>
  <p><em>Funding to provide and maintain the Mines Rescue organisation as an industry organisation for the State should be a charge on the industry.&quot;</em></p>
  <p>(The 1986 Moura Disaster prompted the coordinating committee to re-examine the issue of a single state authority and eventually all three committees agreed that this would be a prudent move.)</p>
  <p>The Brigade was renamed<strong> &ldquo;The Queensland Mines Rescue Brigade&rdquo;</strong>.</p></div>
